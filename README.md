# Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)

The EIP project standardizes and provides high-quality documentation for Ethereum itself and conventions built upon it. This repository tracks past and ongoing improvements to Ethereum in the form of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). [EIP-1] governs how EIPs are published.

## Taxonomy

The [status page][status] tracks and lists EIPs, which can be divided into the following types and categories:

- [Core EIPs] are improvements to the Ethereum consensus protocol.
- [Networking EIPs] specify the peer-to-peer networking layer of Ethereum.
- [Interface EIPs] standardize interfaces to Ethereum, which determine how users and applications interact with the blockchain.
- [ERCs] specify application layer standards, which determine how applications running on Ethereum can interact with each other.
- [Meta EIPs] are miscellaneous improvements that nonetheless require some sort of consensus.
- [Informational EIPs] are non-standard improvements that do not require any form of consensus.

## Contributing

> [!WARNING]
> Before you write an EIP, ideas MUST be thoroughly discussed on [Ethereum Magicians][ethmag] or [Ethereum Research][ethres]. Once consensus is reached, thoroughly read and review [EIP-1], which describes the EIP process.

To create a new proposal, **copy** the [Proposal Template][template] into the [`contents`] directory and rename it to `99999.md` (or `99999/index.md` if you have additional assets). The template has more detailed instructions.

This repository is for documenting standards and not for help implementing them. These types of inquiries should be directed to the [Ethereum Stack Exchange][ethex]. For specific questions and concerns regarding EIPs, it's best to comment on the relevant discussion thread of the EIP denoted by the `discussions-to` tag in the EIP's preamble.

If you would like to become an EIP Editor, please read [EIP-5069].

### Validation and Auto-merging

All pull requests in this repository must pass checks before they can be automatically merged:

- [eip-review-bot] determines when PRs can be automatically merged [^1]
- EIP-1 rules are enforced using [`eipw`] [^2]
- Markdown best practices are checked using [markdownlint] [^2]
- `build-eips` runs targeted proposal validation and site checks for changed proposal files [^2]

Before opening or updating a pull request, run the same CI-style command locally as described in [Editorial Validation](#editorial-validation): `build-eips --staging editorial check --against-upstream --format github`.

## Local Workflows

The EIPs repo uses the shared `build-eips` multi-repo workspace for local site builds, live previews, and editorial validation. The setup script bootstraps the surrounding workspace so, with just a few commands, you can:

* run targeted `eipw` editorial checks for proposals before opening or updating pull requests
* build and serve the EIPs site with the local theme repo and sibling proposal repos like ERCs
* include tracked local edits without committing them first
* render only selected proposals to save time when a full site build is unnecessary
* diagnose missing workspace pieces with `build-eips doctor`

Run the commands below from this EIPs repo. From the workspace root, use `-C EIPs` before the command.

### Minimum Requirements

Local workspace commands require these tools on `PATH`:

* Git
* `build-eips`
* Zola 0.22.1

Git must be installed separately. The setup script locates or installs `build-eips` and Zola, adds locally installed tool directories to `PATH` for the current shell session, and prints guidance for making those `PATH` changes permanent.

### Bootstrap The Workspace

Run the setup script once from this repo.

Linux and macOS:

```sh
./scripts/dev-setup
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\dev-setup.ps1
```

The setup script initializes the workspace one directory above this repo, runs `build-eips doctor`, and prints the next local commands.

After setup, the generated workspace guide is available at `../WORKSPACE.md`. Use that file for the full command reference and workspace details.

After setup, the workspace has this layout:

```text
EIPs-project/
├── .build-eips.toml
├── WORKSPACE.md
├── .local-build/
├── EIPs/
├── ERCs/
└── theme/
```

### Build And Serve Locally

Build the full static site, then preview that built output:

```bash
build-eips build
build-eips preview
```

`preview` serves the last output written by `build`. Run `build` again before `preview` when you want to inspect fresh output.

Use `serve` when you want a live development server that livereloads changes instead of a reusable build output:

```bash
build-eips serve
```

`serve` runs a fresh temporary site build each time it is invoked (without using `build`), starts a local development server, and watches tracked local edits. Its output cannot be reused by `preview`.

Use `check` to quickly validate whether the site will build cleanly without producing the full built site:

```bash
build-eips check
```

By default, `check`, `build`, and `serve` use the local workspace in dirty mode, which includes tracked working-tree edits from this repo. `preview` serves the last output written by `build`. Use `--clean` when you want to ignore tracked local proposal edits for one command:

```bash
build-eips check --clean
build-eips build --clean
build-eips serve --clean
```

For staging, production, parity, and remote-sibling modes, see `../WORKSPACE.md`.

### Local Settings

Local build settings live in `../.build-eips.toml`, which the setup script generates. Use that workspace file to change the local server address or local site URL:

```toml
[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 1111

[site]
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:1111"
```

`serve` and `preview` use `[server]` for the local bind address. `build` and `serve` use `[site].base_url` when generating links.

CLI flags such as `--host`, `--port`, and `--base-url` override the workspace config for one run:

```bash
build-eips serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --base-url http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

### Render Specific Proposals Only

Full local `build` and `serve` runs can take time because they process every proposal file. When you want to quickly test a single proposal or a specific batch, add a list of desired proposal numbers to the workspace `.build-eips.toml`:

```toml
[render]
only = [555, 678]
```

Add one or more proposal numbers in `[render].only`, separated by commas. It's empty by default, but whenever it is populated, the regular `build` and `serve` commands render only those proposal pages. Links and references to excluded proposals are rewritten to the canonical public site.

Use CLI `--only` when you want a one-run target list; it also overrides any proposals in `[render].only` for that run:

```bash
build-eips serve --only 555
build-eips build --only 555
build-eips build --only 555 678
```

Multiple proposal numbers in the CLI are space-separated; no commas.

### Editorial Validation

Use editorial commands to validate proposal files before opening or updating a pull request.

- `editorial lint` runs targeted `eipw` proposal-rule checks.
- `editorial check` runs `editorial lint`, then checks that the selected proposal changes will not prevent the full site from building cleanly.

Check one or more specific proposals by number:

```bash
build-eips editorial check 1
build-eips editorial check 1 123
```

For the closest match to PR CI, use `editorial check` against the proposal files changed versus upstream:

```bash
build-eips --staging editorial check --against-upstream --format github
```

Both commands accept the same selector modes:

* proposal numbers or repo-relative proposal paths for explicit targets
* `--working-tree` for tracked dirty proposal files
* `--against-upstream` for proposal files changed versus the upstream merge-base
* `--batch <path>` for a repeatable target list

They also accept `eipw` options such as `--format github`.

Use a batch file when you want to lint or check the same proposal set repeatedly. A batch file is a plain text file with one proposal number per line:

```txt
1
7949
```

```bash
build-eips editorial lint --batch ../editor-batch.txt
build-eips editorial check --batch ../editor-batch.txt
```

### Full Workspace Reference

For remote staging/production commands, parity commands, source overrides, side-by-side build roots, and detailed dirty-mode behavior, use the generated workspace guide at `../WORKSPACE.md`.

## Preferred Citation Format

The canonical URL for an EIP that has achieved draft status at any point is at <https://eips.ethereum.org/>. For example, the canonical URL for EIP-1 is <https://eips.ethereum.org/1/>.

Consider any document not published at <https://eips.ethereum.org/> as a working paper. Additionally, consider published EIPs with a status of "draft", "review", or "last call" to be incomplete drafts, and note that their specification is likely to be subject to change.
